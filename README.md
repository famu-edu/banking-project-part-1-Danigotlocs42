In this project, you will be focusing on the option of depositing into one of 2 accounts for one user: a checking and savings account. You will also be authenticating the user’s credentials (username and password) at least once. The account details for your customer are as follows:

Customer	Username	Password	Savings Account	Checking Account
Robert Brown	rbrown	blue123	$2500.00	$35.00
Create a C++ program to allow the user to deposit into one of his accounts. The ATM doesn’t distribute or collect coins – all monetary values are in whole dollars (e.g. an integer is an acceptable variable type). Any incorrect transaction types will display an appropriate message and count as a transaction. After a transaction is completed, the program will update the running balance and give the customer a detailed description of the transaction.

Documenting is very important for this course and in this field. Both header comments and step comments are encouraged as it will help for logic to be better. Use the template found in Codio Module 1: Getting Started with Codio, as a guide.

You will be required to submit in a Word documents:

Cover Page
Table of Contents
Statement of Independent Effort
Analysis of Specification
Pseudocode
Flowchart
Test Cases
Code
Grade Sheet
APA References (if needed)
Analysis of specifications is where you identify the inputs, outputs, and processes performed by the code. An example process in a blackjack game would be “generate random card for user”. Remember your test cases should include edge cases (values near the upper and lower bounds of the allowed values), acceptable values, unacceptable values. Produce at least 10 unique cases.

Hint: Spend time thinking about all the ways a user may enter invalid information.
